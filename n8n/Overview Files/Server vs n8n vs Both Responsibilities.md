# ✅ Structured Responsibilities Breakdown

Each action is clearly classified with notes on database requirements, external tools/APIs, and guidance on whether placement on the server or n8n is critical or optional.

## 🗄️ Server Responsibilities

| Action/Responsibility                    | Explanation                                 | DB Required | External Tool/API Required       | Optional? (Server vs n8n)                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| User Authentication (OAuth/JWT)          | Secure user auth, tokens issuance, refresh. | ✅ Yes       | OAuth Providers (Google, GitHub) | ❌ No *(Critical security logic. Must be server.)* |
| CRUD Operations (Projects, Chats, Files) | Basic DB operations & REST endpoints.       | ✅ Yes       | S3 Storage                       | ❌ No *(Strongly recommend server-side.)*          |
| WebSocket Real-time Updates              | Real-time streams & live event handling.    | ✅ Partial   | WebSocket (Socket.IO)            | ❌ No *(Must be server-handled.)*                  |
| File Uploads/Downloads                   | Direct file interactions & storage.         | ✅ Yes       | S3 Storage                       | ❌ No *(Critical on server.)*                      |
| Schema Validation & ORM Management       | DB integrity & migrations.                  | ✅ Yes       | Drizzle, Neon                    | ❌ No *(Strictly server-bound.)*                   |

**Why Server?**

* Security & Authentication require secure handling.
* Direct DB/storage integrations need minimal latency.
* Real-time streams fit server responsibility due to session persistence.

## 🤖 n8n Responsibilities

| Action/Responsibility              | Explanation                               | DB Required | External Tool/API Required | Optional? (Server vs n8n)           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| AI File Generation                 | Document, summary, outline generation.    | ✅ Yes       | OpenAI GPT-4 API           | ❌ No *(Strongly suited for n8n.)*   |
| Embeddings & Semantic Search       | Embeddings & semantic DB searches.        | ✅ Yes       | OpenAI Embeddings API      | ❌ No *(Ideal for n8n.)*             |
| Thumbnail Generation               | Auto thumbnails for uploads.              | ✅ Yes       | Cloudinary/Sharp           | ❌ No *(Ideal for n8n.)*             |
| Scheduled Tasks (Digests, Cleanup) | Automated tasks, email sends, cleanups.   | ✅ Yes       | Email Providers, Slack API | ❌ No *(Fits n8n inherently.)*       |
| Slack/Email Notifications          | Notifications triggered by events.        | ✅ Yes       | Slack API, Email Providers | ❌ No *(Perfectly aligns with n8n.)* |
| Slash-command Parsing & Handling   | User slash-command interactions in chats. | ✅ Yes       | OpenAI GPT-4 API           | ❌ No *(Naturally fits n8n.)*        |

**Why n8n?**

* Automation tasks leverage external APIs.
* Scheduled tasks managed easily via n8n.
* Preference towards n8n supports learning & flexibility.

## 🔄 Combined Responsibilities

| Action/Responsibility               | Explanation                                       | DB Required | External Tool/API Required   | Optional? (Server vs n8n)                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collaborative Notifications         | Server triggers; n8n delivers via Slack/Email.    | ✅ Yes       | Slack API, Email Providers   | ✅ *(Prefer combined; prefer n8n for delivery.)*          |
| File Upload & Post-Processing       | Server initial upload; n8n post-processing.       | ✅ Yes       | S3 Storage, Cloudinary/Sharp | ✅ *(Prefer combined; n8n preferable for flexibility.)*   |
| Project-wide Context & Instructions | Server stores context; n8n dynamically uses it.   | ✅ Yes       | OpenAI GPT-4 API             | ❌ *(Critical hybrid; requires both.)*                    |
| AI-generated Files Storage          | n8n generates; Server persists securely.          | ✅ Yes       | OpenAI GPT-4 API, S3 Storage | ❌ *(Both critical; server required for security.)*       |
| User Collaborator Management        | Server manages invites/access; n8n notifications. | ✅ Yes       | Slack API, Email Providers   | ✅ *(Prefer combined; strongly prefer n8n notification.)* |

**Why Combined?**

* Tasks naturally multi-step requiring server ↔️ n8n collaboration.
* Server for persistence/security; n8n for flexible automation.

---

## 🗝️ Summary of Rationale & Suggestions:

* **Server-only:** Security-critical, low-latency DB/storage tasks.
* **n8n-only:** External API-driven automation & scheduling.
* **Combined:** Tasks needing secure storage (server) and flexible integration (n8n). Prefer combined approach, leaning toward n8n for flexibility.
