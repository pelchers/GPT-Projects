### 🚀 **n8n Frontend-Backend Integration Flow**

```
Frontend component invokes slash-command → useChatApi.ts
    │
    └─ api.ts (POST command)
          │
          └─ server routes.ts (validates and auth via middleware)
                │
                └─ server/n8n-proxy.ts securely triggers n8n webhook
                      │
                      └─ n8n executes appropriate workflow (AI generation)
                            │
                            └─ server receives metadata results
                                  │
                                  └─ Frontend state updated via queryClient.ts
