---

## **1. n8n Setup & Hosting Guides**

*See: Part 1 – n8n Setup & Hosting*

**1A. n8n Cloud Hosting Setup**

* Register with n8n.cloud, Render.com, Railway, or any managed n8n provider.
* Set admin username/password, enable HTTPS, and access n8n editor in your browser.
* Create and activate a workflow with HTTP Trigger node (set to POST).
* Copy the webhook endpoint URL and save to project onboarding docs.
* For integrations (Airtable, Notion, Google Docs):

  * Add as n8n credentials, test all connections.
* Restrict allowed origins as possible; document every endpoint.

**1B. n8n Self-Hosting Guide (Docker, VPS)**

* Provision VPS or cloud server. Install Docker + Compose.
* Use Compose with volumes for `/home/node/.n8n` and, optionally, Postgres.
* Use NGINX/Caddy for HTTPS/SSL, proxy port 443 to n8n’s 5678.
* Secure with N8N\_BASIC\_AUTH\_\*, restrict open ports, and document webhook endpoint.
* Add/test all workflow credentials before production.
* Document onboarding/setup in `/docs/`.

---

## **2. Frontend Web App Setup**

*See: Part 2 – Frontend Web App Setup*

* Built in React (Vite/Next.js), all chat and user actions via OpenUI (main chat) or custom chat components.
* Hooks: `useChatApi.ts` for agent/n8n calls, `usePageContent.ts` for CRUD.
* All API endpoints live in `.env` (never hardcoded).
* Styling via Tailwind; data by React Query.

---

## **3. Database & Storage Configuration**

*See: Part 3 – Database & Storage Configuration (Postgres/Drizzle or Supabase/Zod)*

* Postgres (with Drizzle) or Supabase (with RLS) for all data.
* Users, projects, chats, messages, docs, tokens, subscriptions, audit logs.
* Token quotas/extensions and Stripe integration by schema.
* API keys in backend/n8n only; never public.
* Projects, chats, docs grouped and referenced by foreign key; each context window is last N messages per chat.
* All credentials tested and documented in onboarding.

---

## **4. n8n AI Agent Workflow Design & Configuration**

*See: Part 4 – n8n Ai Agent Workflow Design & Example Flows & Part 4 Continued – Prompt & Workflow Documentation*

* Agent workflow starts with HTTP Trigger (POST).
* Fetches chat context by DB node, builds LLM prompt (commented inline).
* LLM node calls OpenAI or other model.
* Branches: Notion, Airtable, Google Docs by “action”.
* Logs tokens used, updates quota (in DB).
* Node-by-node comments for every step: purpose, inputs/outputs, debugging.
* Export workflow JSON after each major change.

---

## **5. Backend Server Setup (Express/Custom API)**

*See: Part 5 – Frontend ↔ Backend (n8n) Integration*

* Server (`server/`) handles all API endpoints, CRUD, auth, quota logic, and Stripe webhooks.
* Folder structure: routes.ts, db.ts, storage.ts, n8n-proxy.ts, auth middleware (JWT/OAuth).
* Only backend can write sensitive records (tokens, extensions, subscriptions).
* All URLs configurable via `.env`.

---

## **6. Communication & Integration Flow Reference**

*See: Part 5 and 6*

* **Frontend↔n8n:** Chat/agent calls sent to n8n via webhook; n8n uses DB nodes to fetch context/log tokens.
* **Frontend↔Backend:** All user, project, and doc CRUD via secure API endpoints, not n8n.
* **Backend↔n8n:** For quota enforcement and custom agent actions, backend may POST to n8n or n8n may call backend (HTTP Request node).
* **n8n↔Storage:** All credentialed DB and external storage access via n8n Credentials.
* Sample flows and error handling scenarios are included in Part 6.

---

## **7. Database CRUD (Postgres & Supabase)**

*See: Part 3 – CRUD Operations (Postgres, Drizzle, Zod) & Part 3 – CRUD Operations (Supabase, Zod, Stripe Quotas)*

* Every entity (user, project, chat, message, doc, token usage, extension, subscription) has full CRUD via server API or, for n8n-automated system tasks, via DB node.
* All input validated with Zod; every action is auth/role-guarded.

---

## **8. n8n Agent Workflow Patterns, Prompts, and Comments**

*See: Part 4 Continued – Prompt & Workflow Documentation*

* All prompts are built in Set/Function node (with clear comment templates).
* Every workflow node is documented for role, inputs, outputs, debugging, and credentials used.
* Prompts, tokens, and logic are versioned in `/docs/workflows/`.

---

## **9. End-to-End User Flow Demo**

*See: Part 6 – End-to-End User Flow Demo (Expanded)*

* Full sequence for chat, save-to-Notion, project creation, quota/extension, admin audit.
* All requests/responses, error states, and file/route locations are documented with sample payloads.

---

## **10. Optional Enhancements, Scaling, and Advanced Features**

*See: Part 7 – Optional Enhancements, Scaling, and Advanced Features*

* Role-based auth, audit logs, real-time chat, admin dashboards, search, DevOps scaling, multi-tenancy, advanced agent orchestration.
* All best practices for modularity, upgrade paths, and onboarding new team members.

---

## **11. Security & Best Practices**

*See: Part 8 – Security & Best Practices (AI Agent Platform)*

* Secrets management, HTTPS, RBAC, RLS, backup, disaster recovery, Stripe/webhook safety, GDPR/CCPA, and incident response.
* All critical security requirements listed as a versioned checklist.

---

## **12. Docker & Infra Orchestration**

*See: Part 9 (to be created next)*

* Compose file structure, service separation, local vs cloud deployment, .env management.
* All orchestration, migration, and backup scripts documented.

---

## **13. Deliverables, QA, Onboarding Packet**

*See: Part 10 (to be created next)*

* Links to all files and workflows
* Sample .env and Docker Compose templates
* Importable n8n workflow JSONs
* Postman/test suite collection
* Onboarding checklist and “read this first” for new devs/admins/support
